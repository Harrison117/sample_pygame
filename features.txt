Entity is a base class for most objects used in the game. Entities have hitbox features for collision detection. Handles image and rect (hitbox) updates. Entity can either b a  MECH or NATURE entity.


Ship is an Entity that moves, and shoots Bullets using its Weapon. Can collide with other Entities. It's properties/strength are dependent on its given Stats.
    When it is player-controlled:
        - player can switch bullets, and control movement
        - Stats determines player's Ship Strength
    When it is AI-controlled:
        - AI fires and moves according to BulletPathPattern and MovementPathPattern, respectively
        - Stats determines AI's Ship Strength


Bullet is an Entity that moves, and damages Ships when it collides with them. Bullet lifespan ends if it goes out of bounds, hits a Ship, or when manually specified. In some cases can also fire Bullets


Weapon allows ships to fire. Stores a BulletBuilder to build a specified Bullet for firing.


Stats dictate the HP, SP, MS of a Ship, the AS of a Ship's Weapon, and dmg of the Bullet the Ship's Weapon fires.
